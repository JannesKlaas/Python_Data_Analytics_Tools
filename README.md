# Python Data Analytics Tools

This repository was created for the 'Python for Data Analytics' course 2017 at Turing Society Rotterdam.
The class is aimed at business and other social science students so it mainly focuses on statistical procedures common in social sciences, such as hypothesis testing.
Over time, it aims to provide a collection of tools that allows everyone, even with little statistical or programming experience, to run the most important tools very fast and with great ease.
